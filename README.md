# IRIS-Dataset-EDA-and-Machine-Learning
Performing EDA for IRIS data set and performing and Implementing Grid search to find Optimal Hyper parameters for Random forest, Logistic Regression and SVM
Performed EDA 
Explored all the features using histograms
Splitted the data set into two different ratios one is 60% for training and 20% each for testing and validation and the other ratio is 80% for trainig and 10% each for testing and validation.
Performed K fold cross validation
Performed Grid search and implemented the model using Random forest, SVM and Logistic regression.
